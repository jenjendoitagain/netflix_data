Hello!

This is where you will find my Netflix Viz showing some highlights from this data. 

You'll see the count of ratings by genre, count by genre subdivided by type, and then I played around with animating TV and Movie ratings by the year, visualized in bubbles. 

Because who doesn't love bubbles?
